# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains various **design patterns** implemented in Java. Each design pattern follows best practices and demonstrates a real-world use case of its respective pattern.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. Factory Pattern
The **Factory Pattern** provides an interface for creating objects, allowing the subclass to decide which object to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling and flexibility when adding new product types.

### 2. Singleton Pattern
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Itâ€™s used to manage resources efficiently in applications.

### 3. Nton Pattern
The **Nton Pattern** is a generalized form of the Singleton pattern. Instead of restricting instantiation to one instance, it allows a fixed number (`N`) of instances to exist.

# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains various **design patterns** implemented in Java. Each design pattern follows best practices and demonstrates a real-world use case of its respective pattern.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. Abstract Factory Pattern
The **Abstract Factory** Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes, allowing the client to remain independent of the actual product implementations.

Directory: `AbstractFactory/`

### 2. Adapter Pattern
The **Adapter Patter** allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a wrapper that translates requests from one interface to another. It is useful when you want to integrate classes that couldn't otherwise interact due to differing method signatures or interfaces.

Directory: `Adapter/`

### 3. Builder Pattern
The **Builder Pattern** separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful when an object has multiple parts or needs to be constructed in steps.

Directory: `Builder/`

### 4. Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern dynamically adds behavior or functionality to an object without altering its structure, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing.

Directory: `Decorator/`

### 5. Factory Pattern
The **Factory Pattern** provides an interface for creating objects, allowing the subclass to decide which object to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling and flexibility when adding new product types.

Directory: `Factory/`

### 6. Singleton Pattern
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Itâ€™s used to manage resources efficiently in applications.

Directory: `Singleton/`

### 7. Nton Pattern
The **Nton Pattern** is a generalized form of the Singleton pattern. Instead of restricting instantiation to one instance, it allows a fixed number (`N`) of instances to exist.
